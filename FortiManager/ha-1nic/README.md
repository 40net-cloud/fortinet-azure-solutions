# FortiManager High Availability

## Deployment

For the deployment, you can use the Azure Portal, Azure CLI, Powershell or Azure Cloud Shell. The Azure ARM templates are exclusive to Microsoft Azure and can't be used in other cloud environments. The main template is the `azuredeploy.json` which you can use in the Azure Portal. A `deploy.sh` script is provided to facilitate the deployment. You'll be prompted to provide the 4 required variables:

- PREFIX : This prefix will be added to each of the resources created by the template for ease of use and visibility.
- LOCATION : This is the Azure region where the deployment will be deployed.
- USERNAME : The username used to login to the FortiManager GUI and SSH management UI.
- PASSWORD : The password used for the FortiManager GUI and SSH management UI.
