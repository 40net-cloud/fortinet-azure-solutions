# Availability Zone - Active/Passive High Available FortiGate pair with Fabdric Connector Failover

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/jvh-2520/Fortinet-Azure/_apis/build/status/AvailabilityZone/Active-Passive-SDN-AZ?branchName=main)](https://dev.azure.com/jvh-2520/Fortinet-Azure/_build/latest?definitionId=16&branchName=main)

## Introduction

This design operates almost exactly the same as the more common variant using Availability Sets that can be found [here](../../Active-Passive-SDN-AZ/README.md). The main difference between both is that these templates use Availability Zones instead the Availability Sets.

Microsoft defines an Availability Zone to have the following properties:

- Unique physical location with an Azure Region
- Each zone is made up of one or more datacenter(s)
- Independent power, cooling and networking
- Inter Availability Zone network latency < 2ms (radius of +/- 100km)
- Fault-tolerant to protect from datacenter failure

Based on information in the presentation ['Inside Azure datacenter architecture with Mark Russinovich' at Microsoft Ignite 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-0V6bYfTpA)

## Design

VMs running in Microsoft Azure using Availability Zones have a better SLA provided by the platform. Each individual VM in this setup has a 99.99% uptime SLA compared to 99.95% for the VMs running in a Availability Set. SLA documentation from Microsoft can be found [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/sla/virtual-machines/v1_9/).

A cluster of FortiGate VMs will have a cross region/parallel SLA of 99,999999%. More information about the uptime of the Azure datacenter can be found on [this blog post](https://kvaes.wordpress.com/2020/02/16/is-azure-a-tier-3-datacenter-and-what-about-service-levels-in-a-broader-sense/). FortiGate A will be deployed in Zone 1. FortiGate B will deployed in Zone 2. The template can off course be changed to use other zones.

This ARM template can also be used to extend or customized based on your requirements. Additional subnets besides the one's mentioned above are not automatically generated. By adapting the ARM templates you can add additional subnets which preferably require their own routing tables.

## How to deploy

The FortiGate solution can be deployed using the Azure Portal or Azure CLI. There are 4 variables needed to complete kickstart the deployment. The deploy.sh script will ask them automatically. When you deploy the ARM template the Azure Portal will request the variables as a requirement.

- PREFIX : This prefix will be added to each of the resources created by the templates for easy of use, manageability and visibility.
- LOCATION : This is the Azure region where the deployment will be deployed
- USERNAME : The username used to login to the FortiGate GUI and SSH management UI.
- PASSWORD : The password used for the FortiGate GUI and SSH management UI.

### Azure CLI

To deploy via Azure Cloud Shell you can connect via the Azure Portal or directly to [https://shell.azure.com/](https://shell.azure.com/).

- Login into the Azure Cloud Shell
- Run the following command in the Azure Cloud:

`cd ~/clouddrive/ && wget -qO- https://github.com/40net-cloud/fortinet-azure-solutions/archive/main.tar.gz | tar zxf - && cd ~/clouddrive/fortinet-azure-solutions-main/FortiGate/AvailabilityZones/Active-Passive-SDN-AZ/ && ./deploy.sh`

- The script will ask you a few questions to bootstrap a full deployment.

After deployment you will be shown the IP address of all deployed components. You can access both management GUIs and SSH using the public IP address of the load balancer using HTTPS on port 40030, 40031 and for SSH on port 50030 and 50031. THe FortiGate VMs are also accessible using their private IPs on the internal subnet using HTTPS on port 443 and SSH on port 22.

## Requirements and limitations
