## Multi Hub demo with Azure Route Server

# Introduction

More and more enterprises are turning to Microsoft Azure to extend internal data centers and take advantage of the elasticity of the public cloud. While Azure secures the infrastructure, you are responsible for protecting everything you put in it. Fortinet Security Fabric provides Azure the broad protection, native integration and automated management enabling customers with consistent enforcement and visibility across their multi-cloud infrastructure.

This ARM template deploys a High Availability pair of FortiGate Next-Generation Firewalls accompanied by the required infrastructure. Additionally, Fortinet Fabric Connectors deliver the ability to create dynamic security policies.

# Design

In Microsoft Azure, you can deploy an active/passive pair of FortiGate VMs that communicate with each other and the Azure fabric. This FortiGate setup will receive the to be inspected traffic using user defined routing (UDR) and public IPs. You can send all or specific traffic that needs inspection, going to/coming from on-prem networks or public internet by adapting the UDR routing.

This Azure ARM template will automatically deploy a full working environment containing the the following components.

  - 4 FortiGate firewall's in 2 active/passive deployments
  - 2 Hub VNETs and 2 Spoke VNETs. Each hub ha a routeserver subnet and 4 subnets required for the FortiGate deployment (external, internal, ha mgmt and ha sync). If using an existing vnet, it must already have these 5 subnets
	- 2x 3 public IPs. The first public IP is for cluster access to/through the active FortiGate.  The other two PIPs are for Management access. To deploy with public IPs on the FortiGate VMs you can use the 'Azure Portal Wizard - Deploy to Azure' button and select none for the the second and third public IP
  - User Defined Routes (UDR) for the FortiGate VMs
  - Azure Route Server and all configuration on the FortiGate to get started

This ARM template can also be used to extend or customized based on your requirements. Additional subnets besides the one's mentioned above are not automatically generated. By adapting the ARM templates you can add additional subnets which preferably require their own routing tables.

## How to deploy

The FortiGate solution can be deployed using the Azure Portal or Azure CLI. There are 4 variables needed to complete kickstart the deployment. The deploy.sh script will ask them automatically. When you deploy the ARM template the Azure Portal will request the variables as a requirement.

  - PREFIX : This prefix will be added to each of the resources created by the templates for easy of use, manageability and visibility.
  - LOCATION : This is the Azure region where the deployment will be deployed
  - USERNAME : The username used to login to the FortiGate GUI and SSH management UI.
  - PASSWORD : The password used for the FortiGate GUI and SSH management UI.

### Azure CLI

For Microsoft Azure there is a second option by using the Azure Cloud Shell. The Azure Cloud Shell is an in-browser CLI that contains all tools for deployment into Microsoft Azure. It is accesible via the Azure Portal or directly via [https://shell.azure.com/](https://shell.azure.com). You can copy and past the below one-liner to get start with your deployment.
To deploy via Azure Cloud Shell you can connect via the Azure Portal or directly to [https://shell.azure.com/](https://shell.azure.com/).

- Login into the Azure Cloud Shell
- Run the following command in the Azure Cloud:

`cd ~/clouddrive/ && wget -qO- https://github.com/40net-cloud/fortinet-azure-solutions/archive/main.tar.gz | tar zxf - && cd ~/clouddrive/fortinet-azure-solutions-main/FortiGate/AzureRouteServer/MultiHub/ && ./deploy.sh`

- The script will ask you a few questions to bootstrap a full deployment.

After deployment you will be shown the IP address of all deployed components. Both FortiGate VMs are accessible using the public management IPs using HTTPS on port 443 and SSH on port 22.

# Requirements and limitations

The ARM template deploy different resource and it is required to have the access rights and quota in your Microsoft Azure subscription to deploy the resources.

- The template will deploy Standard F4s VMs for this architecture. Other VM instances are supported as well with a minimum of 4 NICs. A list can be found [here](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/6.4.0/azure-cookbook/562841/instance-type-support)
- Licenses for Fortigate
  - BYOL: A demo license can be made available via your Fortinet partner or on our website. These can be injected during deployment or added after deployment. Purchased licenses need to be registered on the [Fortinet support site] (http://support.fortinet.com). Download the .lic file after registration. Note, these files may not work until 60 minutes after it's initial creation.
  - PAYG or OnDemand: These licenses are automatically generated during the deployment of the FortiGate systems.
- The password provided during deployment must need password complexity rules from Microsoft Azure:
  - It must be 12 characters or longer
  - It needs to contain characters from at least 3 of the following groups: uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers, and special characters excluding '\' or '-'
- The terms for the FortiGate PAYG or BYOL image in the Azure Marketplace needs to be accepted once before usage. This is done automatically during deployment via the Azure Portal. For the Azure CLI the commands below need to be run before the first deployment in a subscription.
  - BYOL
`az vm image terms accept --publisher fortinet --offer fortinet_fortigate-vm_v5 --plan fortinet_fg-vm`
  - PAYG
`az vm image terms accept --publisher fortinet --offer fortinet_fortigate-vm_v5 --plan fortinet_fg-vm_payg_2022`

## Fabric Connector

The FortiGate-VM uses [Managed Identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/) for the SDN Fabric Connector. A SDN Fabric Connector is created automatically during deployment. After deployment, it is required apply the 'Reader' role to the Azure Subscription you want to resolve Azure Resources from. More information can be found on the [Fortinet Documentation Libary](https://docs.fortinet.com/vm/azure/fortigate/7.0/azure-administration-guide/7.0.0/236610/creating-a-fabric-connector-using-a-managed-identity).

# FortiGate configuration

The FortiGate VMs need a specific configuration to operate in your environment. This configuration can be injected during provisioning or afterwards via the different management options including GUI, CLI, FortiManager or REST API.

- [Default configuration using this template](doc/config-provisioning.md)
- [High Availability probe](../Active-Passive-ELB-ILB/doc/config-ha.md)
- [Cloud-init](../Active-Passive-ELB-ILB/doc/config-cloud-init.md)
- Inbound connections
- Outbound connections
- East-West connections
