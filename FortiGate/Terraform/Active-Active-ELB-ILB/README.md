# FortiGate Active/Active Load Balanced pair of standalone FortiGate VMs for resilience and scale
*Terraform deployment template for Microsoft Azure*

## Introduction

More and more enterprises are turning to Microsoft Azure to extend or replace internal data centers and take advantage of the elasticity of the public cloud. While Azure secures the infrastructure, you are responsible for protecting the resources you put in it. As workloads are being moved from local data centers connectivity and security are key elements to take into account. FortiGate-VM offers a consistent security posture and protects connectivity across public and private clouds, while high-speed VPN connections protect data.

This Terraform template deploys an Active/Active pair combined with the Microsoft Azure Standard Load Balancer both on the external and the internal side. Additionally, Fortinet Fabric Connectors deliver the ability to create dynamic security policies.

## Design

In Microsoft Azure, this central security service hub is commonly implemented using local VNET peering. The central security services hub component will receive, using user-defined routing (UDR), all or specific traffic that needs inspection going to/coming from on-prem networks or the public internet.

This Terraform template will automatically deploy a full working environment containing the the following components.

  - 2 FortiGate firewalls in an active/active deployment
  - 1 external Azure Standard Load Balancer for communication with internet
  - 1 internal Azure Standard Load Balancer to receive all internal traffic and forwarding towards Azure Gateways connecting ExpressRoute or Azure VPNs.
  - 1 VNET with 2 protected subnets
  - User Defined Routes (UDR) for the protected subnets

This Terraform template can also be used to extend or customize based on your requirements. Additional subnets besides the ones mentioned above are not automatically generated. By adapting the Terraform templates additional subnets can be added. Additional subnets will require their own routing tables.

## Deployment

For the deployment Terraform is required. This multi-cloud deployment tool can be downloaded from the website of [Hashicorp](https://www.terraform.io/) who created and maintains it. You can either run the different stage manually (terraform init, plan, apply). Additionally, a `deploy.sh` script is provided to facilitate the deployment. You'll be prompted to provide the 4 required variables:

- PREFIX : This prefix will be added to each of the resources created by the template for ease of use and visibility.
- LOCATION : This is the Azure region where the deployment will be deployed.
- USERNAME : The username used to login to the FortiGate GUI and SSH management UI.
- PASSWORD : The password used for the FortiGate GUI and SSH management UI.

For Microsoft Azure there is a fast track option by using the Azure Cloud Shell. The Azure Cloud Shell is an in-browser CLI that contains Terraform and other tools for deployment into Microsoft Azure. Azure Cloud Shell is accessible via the Azure Portal or directly via [https://shell.azure.com/](https://shell.azure.com). You can copy and past the below one-liner to get start with your deployment.

`cd ~/clouddrive/ && wget -qO- https://github.com/fortinet/azure-templates/archive/main.tar.gz | tar zxf - && cd ~/clouddrive/azure-templates-main/FortiGate/Terraform/Active-Active-ELB-ILB/ && ./deploy.sh`

After deployment you will be shown the IP address of all deployed components, this information is also stored in the output directory in the `summary.out` file. You can access both management GUIs and SSH using the public IP address of the load balancer using HTTPS on port 40030, 40031 and for SSH on port 50030 and 50031.

!!! Beware that the output directory, Terraform Plan file and Terraform State files contain deployment information such as password, usernames, IP addresses and others.

## Requirements and limitations

The Terraform template deployment deploys different resources and is required to have the access rights and quota in your Microsoft Azure subscription to deploy the resources.

### Licenses

- The template will deploy Standard F4s VMs to deploy the required active/active setup. Other VM instances are supported as well with a minimum of 2 NICs. A list can be found [here](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/6.2.0/azure-cookbook/562841/instance-type-support)
- Licenses for Fortigate
  - BYOL: Demo license can be made available via your Fortinet partner or on our website. These can be injected during deployment or added after deployment.
  - PAYG or OnDemand: These licenses are automatically generated during the deployment of the FortiGate systems.

### Fabric Connector
The FortiGate-VM uses [Managed Identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/) for the SDN Fabric Connector. A SDN Fabric Connector is created automatically during deployment. After deployment, it is required apply the 'Reader' role to the Azure Subscription you want to resolve Azure Resources from. More information can be found on the [Fortinet Documentation Libary](https://docs.fortinet.com/vm/azure/fortigate/7.0/azure-administration-guide/7.0.0/236610/creating-a-fabric-connector-using-a-managed-identity).

### North South traffic
When configuring the policies on the FortiGates to allow and forward traffic to internal hosts, it is recommended that you enable the NAT checkbox (this will S-NAT the packets to the IP of port2). Doing so will enforce symmetric return.

It is possible to use FGSP to synchronize sessions and thereby allow assymetric return traffic. However this is not best practice from a security perspective, because it limits the ability of IPS by potentially only seeing one side of the conversation on each FGT. The FortiGate IPS takes both sides of the conversation into account for increased security and visibility. Reducing this visibility on the FortiGate may decrease the IPS efficacy.

Often S-NAT is not desired because it's necessary to retain the original source IP. For HTTP or HTTPS traffic in particular, you can enable the Load Balancing feature on the FortiGate which gives you the option to copy the source IP into the X-Forwarded-For header (See https://docs.fortinet.com/uploaded/files/3637/fortigate-load-balancing-56.pdf)

If you do prefer to use FGSP for session synchronization. It can be enable during deployment by uncommenting the section in the customdata.tpl file or adding this recommended configuration to both FortiGate VMs.

```
config system ha
    set session-pickup enable
    set session-pickup-connectionless enable
    set session-pickup-nat enable
    set session-pickup-expectation enable
    set override disable
end

config system cluster-sync
    edit 0
        set peerip 172.16.136.x
        set syncvd "root"
    next
end
```
* Where x in 172.16.136.x is the IP of port 1 of the opposite FortiGate. With the default values this would be either 5 or 6.

### Configuration synchronization
The FortiGate VMs are in this Active/Active setup independent units. They don't use FGCP as a protocol to sync the configuration like in the Active/Passive setup. To enable configuration sync between both unit the sync from the autoscaling setup can be used. This will sync all configuration except for the specific configuration item proper to the specific VM like hostname, routing and others. To enable the configuration sync the config below can be used on both

FortiGate A
```
config system auto-scale
    set status enable
    set role master
    set sync-interface "port2"
    set psksecret "a big secret"
end
```

FortiGate B
```
config system auto-scale
    set status enable
    set sync-interface "port2"
    set master-ip 172.16.136.69
    set psksecret "a big secret"
end
```
