# Deployment templates for FortiGate Next-Generation Firewall in Microsoft Azure

## Use cases

The FortiGate can be used in different scenario's to protect assets deployed in Microsoft Azure Virtual Networks.

- Secure hybrid cloud
- Cloud security services hub
- Logical (intent-based) segmentation
- Secure remote access

Click [here](https://www.fortinet.com/products/public-cloud-security/azure#usecases) for a general overview of the different public cloud use cases.

## Resiliency and High Availability

When designing a reliable architecture in Microsoft Azure it is important to take resiliency and High Availability into account. Microsoft has the [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency/overview) available.

Running the FortiGate Next-Generation Firewall inside of Microsoft Azure can offer different levels of reliability based on these building blocks

### SLA

Microsoft offers different [SLAs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/support/legal/sla/virtual-machines/) on Microsoft Azure based on the deployment used.
- [Availability Zone](AvailabilityZones/) (different datacenter in the same region): 99,99%
- Availability Set (different rack and power): 99,95%
- Single VM with Premium SSD: 99.9%

A cluster of FortiGate VMs will have a cross region/parallel SLA of 99,999975% when using Availability Sets. A cluster of FortiGate VMs will have a cross region/parallel SLA of 99,999999% when using Availability Zones. More information about the uptime of the Azure datacenter can be found on [this blog post](https://kvaes.wordpress.com/2020/02/16/is-azure-a-tier-3-datacenter-and-what-about-service-levels-in-a-broader-sense/).

### Building blocks

- [__**A Single VM**__](A-Single-VM/): This single FortiGate VM will process all the traffic and as such become a single point of failure during operations as well as upgrades. This block can also be used in an architecture with multiple regions where a FortiGate is deployed in each region. This setup provides an SLA of 99.9% when using a Premium SSD disk.

</p

- [__**Active/Passive with Fabric Connector Failover**__](Active/Passive-SDN): This design will deploy 2 FortiGate VMs in Active/Passive connected using unicast FGCP HA protocol. This protocol will synchronize the configuration. On failover the passive FortiGate takes control and will issue api calls to Microsoft Azure to shift the Public IP and update the internal User Defined Routing (UDR) to itself. Shifting the public IP and gateway IPs of the routes will take some time to complete on the Microsoft Azure platform. Microsoft provides a general architecture [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/dmz/nva-ha#pip-udr-nvas-without-snat), in the FortiGate case the API calls logic is built in instead of requiring additional outside logic like Azure Functions or ZooKeeper nodes.

</p

- [__**Active/Passive with external and internal Azure Load Balancer**__](Active-Passive-ELB-ILB): This design will deploy 2 FortiGate VMs in Active/Passive connected using the unicast FGCP HA protocol. The failover of the traffic in this setup is handled by the Microsoft Azure Load Balancer using a health probe towards the FortiGate VMs. THe failover times are based on the health probe of the Microsoft Azure Load Balancer (2 failed attempts per 5 seconds with a max of 15 seconds). The public IPs are configured on the Microsoft Azure Load Balancer and provide ingress and egress flows with inspection from the FortiGate. Microsoft provides some guidance on this architecture [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-ha-ports-overview).

</p

- [__**Active/Active with external and internal Azure Load Balancer**__](Active-Active-ELB-ILB): This design will deploy 2 FortiGate VMs in Active/Active as 2 independent systems. The failover of the traffic in this setup is handled by the Microsoft Azure Load Balancer using a health probe towards the FortiGate VMs. The public IPs are configured on the Microsoft Azure Load Balancer and provide ingress and egress flows with inspection from the FortiGate. To sync the configuration of this setup a FortiManager or local replication can be used. Microsoft provides some guidance on this architecture [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-ha-ports-overview).

</p

*By default these building blocks are using Availability Sets. The Availability Zone templates are also available [here](AvailabilityZones/) for a higher SLA.*

## Selecting your architecture in Microsoft Azure

The FortiGate Next-Generation Firewall can be deployed in Microsoft Azure in different architectures each with their specific properties that can be an advantage or disadvantage in your environment.

- __**Single VNET**__: All the building block above are ready to deploy in a new or existing VNET. Select your block above to get started.
- [__**Cloud Security Services Hub (VNET peering)**__](VNET-peering/): With VNET peering it is possible to have different islands deploying different services managed by diferent internal and/or external teams but to maintain a single point of control going to on-premise, other clouds or public internet. By connecting the different VNETs in a Hub-Spoke setup the Hub can control all traffic. Get started [here](VNET-Peering/)
- [__**Autoscaling**__](Autoscale/): For application that are fluid in the amount of resources the FortiGate can also be deployed with a autoscaling architecture. This architecture is documented [here](https://docs.fortinet.com/vm/azure/fortigate/6.4/azure-cookbook/6.4.0/161167/deploying-auto-scaling-on-azure) or a quickstart script is available [here](Autoscale/)
- [__**Azure Virtual WAN**__](AzureVirtualWAN/): Azure Virtual WAN offers a central connectivity point between regions, on-premise. Fortinet offers [automation](https://www.fortinet.com/content/dam/fortinet/assets/deployment-guides/dg-fortigate-azure-wan-integration.pdf) as well as [different deployment modes](AzureVirtualWAN/).
- [__**SD-WAN Connectivity**__](SD-WAN/): Connecting the on-premise environment with your Microsoft Azure environment.

Coming soon...

- __**Multi region - Azure Traffic Manager**__
- __**Azure Application Gateway**__
