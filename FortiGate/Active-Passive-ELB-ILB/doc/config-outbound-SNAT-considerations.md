FortiGates VM require outbound connectivity to the Internet. The frontend IPs of a public load balancer can be used to provide outbound connectivity to the internet for backend instances. This configuration uses source network address translation (SNAT) to translate virtual machine's private IP into the load balancer's public IP address. SNAT maps the IP address of the backend to the public IP address of your load balancer.
