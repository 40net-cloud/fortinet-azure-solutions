# Active/Passive High Available FortiGate pair with external and internal Azure Standard Load Balancer

## Introduction

In FortiGate 7.0.x release it is not possible to deploy a FGCP cluster with only 3 NICs instead of four. The HA MGMT and HA SYNC are combined into 1 inteface. All other deployment information can be found [here](/FortiGate/Active-Passive-ELB-ILB/README.md).
