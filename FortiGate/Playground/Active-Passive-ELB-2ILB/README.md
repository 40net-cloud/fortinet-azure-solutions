# FortiGate Active/Passive High Availability with Azure Standard Load Balancer - External and Internal

# Introduction

This design adds a second internal interface to seperate for example ExpressRoute, use zones or VDOM. Deployment is similar to the basic building block Active-Passive with Exteral and Internal Azure Load Balancer found [here](../../Active-Passive-ELB-ILB/README.md). The main difference is that we added an extra network interface. A Terraform version is available [here](Terraform/)

# Design

In Microsoft Azure, you can deploy an active/passive pair of FortiGate VMs that communicate with each other and the Azure fabric. This FortiGate setup will receive the traffic to be inspected traffic using user defined routing (UDR) and public IPs. You can send all or specific traffic that needs inspection, going to/coming from on-prem networks or public internet by adapting the UDR routing.

This Azure ARM template will automatically deploy a full working environment containing the following components.

  - 2 FortiGate firewall's in an active/passive deployment
  - 1 external Azure Standard Load Balancer for communication with internet
  - 1 internal Azure Standard Load Balancer to receive all internal traffic and forwarding towards Azure Gateways connecting ExpressRoute or Azure VPN's
  - 1 VNET with 5 subnets required for the FortiGate deployment (external, internal, internal2, ha mgmt and ha sync). If using an existing vnet, it must already have 5 subnets
  - 3 public IPs. The first public IP is for cluster access to/through the active FortiGate.  The other two PIPs are for Management access
  - User Defined Routes (UDR) for the protected subnets

## How to deploy

The FortiGate solution can be deployed using the Azure Portal or Azure CLI. There are 4 variables needed to complete kickstart the deployment. The deploy.sh script will ask them automatically. When you deploy the ARM template the Azure Portal will request the variables as a requirement.

  - PREFIX : This prefix will be added to each of the resources created by the templates for easy of use, manageability and visibility.
  - LOCATION : This is the Azure region where the deployment will be deployed
  - USERNAME : The username used to login to the FortiGate GUI and SSH management UI.
  - PASSWORD : The password used for the FortiGate GUI and SSH management UI.

### Azure CLI

For Microsoft Azure there is a second option by using the Azure Cloud Shell. The Azure Cloud Shell is an in-browser CLI that contains all tools for deployment into Microsoft Azure. It is accesible via the Azure Portal or directly via [https://shell.azure.com/](https://shell.azure.com). You can copy and past the below one-liner to get start with your deployment.
To deploy via Azure Cloud Shell you can connect via the Azure Portal or directly to [https://shell.azure.com/](https://shell.azure.com/).

- Login into the Azure Cloud Shell
- Run the following command in the Azure Cloud:

`cd ~/clouddrive/ && wget -qO- https://github.com/40net-cloud/fortinet-azure-solutions/archive/main.tar.gz | tar zxf - && cd ~/clouddrive/fortinet-azure-solutions-main/FortiGate/Playground/Active-Passive-ELB-2ILB/ && ./deploy.sh`

- The script will ask you a few questions to bootstrap a full deployment.

After deployment you will be shown the IP address of all deployed components. Both FortiGate VMs are accessible using the public management IPs using HTTPS on port 443 and SSH on port 22.
