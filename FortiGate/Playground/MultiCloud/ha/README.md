# Deployment of FortiGate-VM HA on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
## Introduction
A Terraform script to deploy FortiGate-VM HA (A-P) on GCP.

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 0.12.0
* Terraform Provider for Google Cloud Platform 2.11.0
* Terraform Provider for Google Cloud Platform Beta 2.13
* Terraform Provider for random 2.2.1
* Terraform Provider for template 2.1.2
* A [GCP service account key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys)

## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with one public subnet
   - A VPC with three private subnets
   - Two FortiGate-VM instances with four NICs
   - Four firewall rules: one for external, one for internal, one for sync, and one for HA management.

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VM to GCP:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Rename the service account key file to `account.json` and put account.json file to the directory.
3. Customize variables in the `vars.tf` file as needed.
4. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
5. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
6. Verify output.
7. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
8. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGate-VM instances:
```sh
FortiGate-HA-Cluster-IP = XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
FortiGate-HA-Master-MGMT-IP = XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
FortiGate-HA-Slave-MGMT-IP = XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
FortiGate-Password = <password here>
FortiGate-Username = admin
```

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
