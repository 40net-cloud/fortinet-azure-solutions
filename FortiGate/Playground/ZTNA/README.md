# FortiGate Next-Generation Firewall - ZTNA

## Deployment

For the deployment, you can use the Azure Portal, Azure CLI, Powershell or Azure Cloud Shell. The Azure ARM templates are exclusive to Microsoft Azure and can't be used in other cloud environments. The main template is the `azuredeploy.json` which you can use in the Azure Portal. A `deploy.sh` script is provided to facilitate the deployment. You'll be prompted to provide the 4 required variables:

- PREFIX : This prefix will be added to each of the resources created by the template for ease of use and visibility.
- LOCATION : This is the Azure region where the deployment will be deployed.
- USERNAME : The username used to login to the FortiGate GUI and SSH management UI.
- PASSWORD : The password used for the FortiGate GUI and SSH management UI.

## Requirements and limitations

More information can be found [here](/FortiGate/A-Single-VM/README.md).

## FortiGate configuration

The FortiGate VMs need a specific configuration to match the deployed environment. This configuration can be injected during provisioning or afterwards via the different options including GUI, CLI, FortiManager or REST API.

This template used the default A Single VM ARM template. This tempalte already configures different aspects of the FortiGate during deployment. This configuration can be found [here](/FortiGate/A-Single-VM/doc/config-provisioning.md). Aditionaly, the below config is injected during provisioning with the correct values in bold replaced for your environment.

<pre><code>
config firewall address
  edit webserver1
    set subnet <b>w.x.y.z</b> 255.255.255.255
  next
end
config firewall addrgrp
