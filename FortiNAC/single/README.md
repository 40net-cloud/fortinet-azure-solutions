## Introduction

FortiNAC is a zero-trust access solution that oversees and protects all digital assets connected to the enterprise network, covering devices ranging from IT, IoT, OT/ICS, to IoMT. 

## Design

In Microsoft Azure, this single FortiNAC-VM setup a basic setup to start exploring the capabilities.

This Azure ARM template will automatically deploy a full working environment containing the following components.

- 1 FortiNAC VM with a 1Tb data disk for log storage
- 1 VNETs containing a subnet for the FortiNAC
- Optional: 1 Standard public IP

This Azure ARM template can also be extended or customized based on your requirements. Additional subnets besides the ones mentioned above are not automatically generated.

## Deployment

For the deployment, you can use the Azure Portal, Azure CLI, Powershell or Azure Cloud Shell. The Azure ARM templates are exclusive to Microsoft Azure and can't be used in other cloud environments. The main template is the `mainTemplate.json` which you can use in the Azure Portal. A `deploy.sh` script is provided to facilitate the deployment. You'll be prompted to provide the 4 required variables:

- PREFIX : This prefix will be added to each of the resources created by the template for ease of use and visibility.
- LOCATION : This is the Azure region where the deployment will be deployed.
- USERNAME : The username used to login to the FortiNAC GUI and SSH management UI.
- PASSWORD : The password used for the FortiNAC GUI and SSH management UI.
